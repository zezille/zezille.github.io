                <h2>Telepathic penetration</h2> 

                    <p>And so begins telepathic penetration session on Jana Masaryka tram stop during a public discussion about national identity of Franz Kafka. Both Czech and German youth representatives sit quietly on black conference chairs placed on metal tram tracks. All eyes are on speaker passing a microphone to a next standing lad masturbating on a fluffy pomeranian spitz. The girls cotton to online stores, thickly smearing their thighs with red lipstick so that their greased and waxed asses slide of the chairs onto the asphalt like those of hamadryas baboons. A huge pool of blood formed under the seats. 
                    
                    After excessively boring speech of 9 hours, a few lads overdosed the moment they knew the discussion was translated on local TV. Moans spread the crowd, so confused tram drivers tear off their underwear as a sign of protest against society and wipe potraviny windows with them. 
                    
                    After orgic consolation, the silent throng sighed and glanced at starry night sky. That was the first time citizens decided to black out, so they could see it. 9 hours have passed since the beginning of the telepathic penetration. 
                    
                     
                    
                    Predictably, Franz Kafka’s fate wasn’t determined at the meeting. They asked participants to push the chairs into the nearest store and shove other chairs into the district court Prahy 2, because there is strike and the guards have nothing to sit on. A girl came in, dragging two chairs behind.  
                    
                    I guess those are for you, she said. 
                    
                    The older guard nodded and conspiratorially whispered something to a younger guard.   
                    
                    Well, miss, it is none of anyone’s business and I suppose hardly anybody would be curious about it, but I must insist..., - the younger guard was fidgeting and cowering, reminding of a crushed beetle. 
                    
                    Yeah, I abandoned their family after with an amandment to the introduction of law #480., she interrupted his weak attempts to ask a question. 
                    
                    “What’s about that one”, asked an old guard. Then she explained that the law states: “Every person ever being involved in the Franz Kafka and his nationality issue is immediately forced to leave the Czech Republic and forget the Czech language.” The poor Czechs, when they read about this in news, promptly began to try to forget Czech. One of them tried so hard that he unlearnt how to speak. At least Germans were luckier as they got nothing to forget. 
                    
                    A week passed by, everyone forgot about telepathic penetration. It seemed that Kafka topic could be closed, but abrupt rating falling of the ruling party indicated the need to improve the situation. The decision was made: the goy needed a holiday. 
                    
                     
                    
                    As a part of PR campaign provided by LinkedIn professionals, authorities organized a new annual national celebration — hunt on foreigners. Here is what you do: you take your passport, show it at the checkout in Albert or Billa and a cashier provides you with a gun and rubber bullets or some kind of firecracker, then you go with this gun to look for some foreign granny. If you are lucky enough — you load the firecracker under the old pussy's dress so that she shits herself on the spot; if you do so you gotta burst with laughter as loudly as possible so that everyone hears about your ringing success. Of course, do not ignore children and women.  
                    
                     
                    
                    As you may have already understood, that day the whole country laughed loudly, many people got six-pack abs from constant laughter and in general the holiday-punishment affected the appearance of the inhabitants and as a result their sexual ability. The demographics began to grow exponentially and in two days there were more Czechs than Chinese. But since the country is small, there was not enough space for everyone and it turned out that many citizens were sitting on each other's necks; and because of that the codependent human skyscrapers were formed. Well, and on top they covered it with a huge wooden board, nailed boards into it, rubbed them with varnish and put the Ministry of Human Skyscraper Affairs. 
                    
                     
                    
                    The new ministry functioned flawlessly, so everyone was happy. Neighboring countries of the European Union looked with envy at their bastardly happy partners and tried to fuck them. Things escalated to such an extent that a decision was made to dispose of all the lube, abandon the cities, and crawl to the tops of human skyscrapers. A gathering was also held with representatives from the USA, France, Japan, Canada, Italy, and the UK, resulting in a resolution for the immediate cleansing of cities from all reminders of civilization. 
                    
                      
                    
                    In a matter of days, the cities turned into endless fields, the steppen wolf returned to the womb of Mother Earth. A colonnade approached the ruins of the former metropolis, in red robes, with torches in their left hands, they conducted a purification ritual, blessing the land for a new life, freed from the suffering of human occupation. 
                    
                      
                    
                    Within a minute, dozens of rows of thousands of people fell to their knees and struck their foreheads against the cold soil. Out of the corner of the eye, one could see a high-ranking servant slowly walking. Silence spread for kilometers like a dull hammer blow, far beyond which only the cries of infants and the rustle of leaves could be heard — the wind was reciting sonnets to long-dead lovers. It seemed to me that the servant was very old and ill. He moved slowly, shuffling his bare, veiny feet, his dry, bluish lips barely parting — he could barely see. Bleeding, pulsating wounds made it impossible to look at him directly; drops of blood fell onto the long lashes of young boys, yet no one could move — the body now obeyed no one but the servant. And the servant obeyed to its own body as a man should. Not must but should: BODY IS A PROPERTY OF A SERVANT, BUT HE IS NOT THE OWNER.  
                    
                      
                    
                    After twenty minutes, a sage with a long beard hobbled to the center of the circle. From his left sleeve, he pulled out a bottle of dark Kozel and threw it into a pit. Assistants buried it, and cult servants of the 3rd rank addressed the wise one: 
                    
                    “O Great Keeper of European Knowledge, allow us to know what message you have left for our descendants?” 
                    
                      
                    
                    The sage paid no attention to the 3rd-rank servant and walked on. As he moved, a 4th-rank servant approached him and asked the same question: 
                    
                    “Blessings upon your stinking feet, Great Sage, O Head of Steel. Permit me, a fool and your servant, to ask a question: what did you write in the message to the future?” 
                    
                      
                    
                    The sage looked at him, smiled, and walked on. The servants began to beat their foreheads against the earth and cry out madly. The procession gathered and promptly left the city. 
                    
                      
                    
                    On the path to the New World, the sage encountered servants from ranks 1 to 174, but he answered none of them. 
                    
                    “Why do you remain silent?” asked a young man with curly blond hair and such a lively, such a vital blush on his cheeks. The sage embraced the youth and gently kissed him on the forehead. And in that moment, the young man understood everything. 
                    
                      
                    
                    No one truly realized it, but in the name of love, in the name of mystery, in the name of ecstatic experience — the sage could not answer. For by answering, the mystery would be destroyed. 
                    
                      
                    
                    The young man passed the sage’s answer to the other servants, and all 174 ranks began kissing each other gently on the forehead until they grasped the essence of the message. An atmosphere of unity, compassion, and love descended. 
                    
                      
                    
                    However, the 3rd- and 4th-rank servants were not satisfied with the answer. It seemed too obvious. They distanced themselves from the crowd and returned to the still-smoldering ritual fire. From under the ashes, they unearthed the bottle of the Black Goat, looked inside, and found a note describing the secret origin of Franz Kafka. 
                    
                      
                    
                    Horrified, the two servants began to fumble for their pistols — when suddenly, the sky erupted with the sound of sirens, and the light of white searchlights shattered the night into millions of fragments. A strong wind rose from the approaching helicopters carrying special forces. 
                    
                      
                    
                    The servants fled, with military personnel and German shepherds chasing after them, armed with automatic pistols. 
                    
                     
                    
                    By a twist of fate, the servants became bricks in the great wall of the building of the New Court, guarding the secret of Franz Kafka right up until the moment when, during a strike, guards Scholz and Gerald sold the last chairs to buy a new edition of the Encyclopedia of Lost Civilizations. 
                    
                      
                    
                    After a full lunch and creamy dessert, the National Skyscraper Police Directorate, in collaboration with the Glass Parliament, issued a final decree for the extermination of foreigners, locals with democratic views, redheads, narrow-hipped prostitutes, and other unstable types — followed by universal happiness for all toothy, fair-haired, well-fed, and amicable citizens. 
                    
                      
                    
                    Each of them, in turn, was shackled, so that the skyscraper structure would hold better after the recent incident with the rotten plank of the Ministry. 
                    
                      
                    
                    Once the decree was implemented, everyone was happy and laughed loudly. 
                    
                     
                    
                     
                    
                     
                    
                     
                    
                    <h2>Explanation</h2> 
                    
                     
                    
                    How exactly does telepathic penetration occur? 
                    
                    Please take your pens and begin integrating your loneliness. 
                    
                    Disarm the toothless monkey. 
                    
                      
                    
                    In five minutes, you will be handed a form in which you’ll assess the physical parameters of your loved ones: such as heart rhythm, number of missed identity crises, and the abundance of neurotransmitters in the buttocks. 
                    
                      
                    
                    The same procedure will be performed by your relatives in regard to you. 
                    
                    Your further destiny will depend on how they describe you — whether they use epithets or not. 
                    
                      
                    
                    If more than a third of your kin declare your image faded in their consciousness, we will be forced to subject your existence to review. 
                    
                      
                    
                    As long as you are remembered — you are. 
                    
                    As soon as you are forgotten — you will become happy. 
                    
                      
                    
                    We hope you will vanish into oblivion, and we are working tirelessly to make this happen. 
                    
                      
                    
                    Dissolve into Being. 
                    
                    Dissolve into the Great Ape. 
                    
                     
                    
                     
                    
                    <h2>State</h2> 
                    
                    Just as the state forbids thinking OUTSIDE the state, so too does the mind forbid thinking OUTSIDE consciousness. 
                     Telepathic penetration is an attempt to go beyond the frame of the individual’s mind. It is an attempt to bypass the existing order, nailed shut with spikes hammered into flesh. I look into the eyes of a stranger and become them. A second is worth more than eternity, because eternity gathers itself inside a single second. A second lived outside of consciousness is equal to the fruits of a grand and lush kingdom of thought and living waters that nourish the dwellers of golden harvests. 
                    
                    As one of my dear acquaintances once told me: I’m only good for sexual entertainment. Honestly, I’m not really into sex, but I enjoy the part of BDSM where I’m the lab rat and upper management praises me, gives me a medal for masochistic bravery. 
                     – Oh God, the way you inserted that pineapple! Masterful! 
                     – And the way you stoically endured that comparison to the ex! A hero! 
                    
                    Then this old friend of mine shows up — I haven’t seen him in a hundred years — and he starts rambling about some sack of cement by the front door. 
                     – Can you imagine… this sack of cement just sits there. For a month. I didn’t pay it any attention. But just recently, I decided to check it out. I didn’t know at that point if it was cement or something more interesting. I look, and you know what it says on it? You know what, goddamn it? It has my birthday on it. 
                     – Okay… 
                     – No, listen, I figured maybe that’s just a coincidence. But then the last part hit me. You’ll freak out. Fifteen minutes. 
                     – What fifteen minutes? 
                     – I was born at 7:15. That fucking bag has my date of birth and the exact minute. Sure, the date—whatever. But that fifteen? Out of all the minutes in the world. That’s fucked up. A sack of cement, man. 
                     – A sack. Of cement. 
                     – Yeah, goddammit. It’s a sign. 
                     – A sign of what? 
                     – I don’t know! How would I know? It’s a fucking sack of cement. 
                    
                    All this time I felt like I was talking to the Faceless One, but I knew it was that same old friend. 
                     Your thoughts will drift like a cloud through the vaults of memory. Don’t stop them. Don’t fight them. Let them flow on. Control begins when you let go. 
                     The goal of telepathic penetration: to ride the Great Monkey. Never forget that. 
                    
                    I felt the voice of the guide fading, and a crushing boredom and loneliness crept in, mixed with freedom and joy. I was overflowing with this cocktail of emotions — I was literally vomiting my guts out. And suddenly I remembered this woman who earned 8 euros an hour to pretend to be a housewife in a mock kitchen setup somewhere in some backwater town with like 1,000 people tops. 8 euros an hour to simulate cooking or cleaning. That’s exactly how I felt. 
                    
                    About thirteen hours passed. I was exhausted. I was starting to doubt if this penetration was real or just some ordinary hypnotic state during which I was being smuggled across the border into Transnistria. I subjected my decision to a martyr’s level of self-analysis, merciless and very much not in my favor. I calculated for hours the possible outcomes of this or that action, trying to control my thoughts, but the mental effort gave me paranoia and fear of the state. 
                    
                    What fucking Great Monkey? I’m losing it. Trust me, I considered surrender. I am surrendered. I live inside consciousness, inside state-borders. I have, so to speak, grasped the Great Monkey and served my sentence. And now I am dead. Dead like any decent citizen who realized that living too long is an unaffordable luxury. And I died. 
                    
                    So what now? I don’t get it. I did some stuff. Maybe something of me remains. Wonderful. And then what? Will the Great Monkey pat me on the head? I was a happy citizen with a full belly and I died. Maybe someone will toss in the last handful of dirt. Or maybe I’ll remain in a Guy Fawkes mask. 
                    
                    And then comes the drugged euphoria! 
                     And then the first, the fifth, the tenth. 
                     And then my fucking relatives cry for a few months, decide it’s time to move on — because life doesn’t end — and laugh loudly again. 
                     And then they build insanely tall skyscrapers. 
                    
                    And the most horrifying part? 
                     They’ll be right. 
                    
                    – Oh come now, dear citizen, eat your wheat porridge and die a proper death. We’ll bury you and plant a tall oak on top. 
                      
                    
                    It was my decision to stop making decisions and just stare. Stare long and hard. 
                     In the endless desert there was nothing the eye could hold on to, so I chose to stare at my own feet. Thoughts buzzed like flies, trying to crack my mind open — mixed in with memories of my beloved friend, grains of sand beneath my nails, and a soft sea breeze. 
                     My body was getting heavier. 
                    
                    I entered a state of penetration — the highest point of knowing, or rather the point beyond knowing. 
                     I am blissful. 
                     I am blessed. 
                    
                     
                    
                    <h2>Introduction to Telepathic Penetration</h2>
                     I will slowly ease you into a trance. 
                     The goal of penetration is to infiltrate your Monkey — to guide the psyche into a state of vegetative reproduction. 
                     Take a deep breath in  and exhale slowly. 
                     Repeat: deep inhale, deep exhale. And again. 
                    
                    Do not avoid your thoughts — we’ll need them later to poison the cockroaches. 
                     Meanwhile, your neighbor on the next chair is going at it — keep breathing, leave the poor soul alone in your mind, for your thought and your body — do not exist as one. In fact, they don’t exist at all. Just like you. 
                     Keep breathing. 
                    
                    I’ll send a guide for the journey. 
                     Remember: there is no safe word. 
                     And once you set foot on the path of the Great Monkey — there is no return. 
                     Yes, you might get lost. You might think it’s the end — but it’s not. 
                     Remember: every state in penetration is temporary, just like penetration itself. 
                    
                    Who do you see? 
                     Is it a woman or a man? 
                     Young or old? 
                     Or maybe… not a person at all? 
                     Keep breathing. 
                    
                    Can you hear what they’re saying? 
                     Or are they silent? 
                     Don’t be afraid. They love you. 
                     They are your guide — not a drunkard, not a lazy bum ready to sucker punch you mid-trip. 
                     They are with you, even though if you look closely — they have no face. No eyes. No nose. No mouth. 
                     Faceless, and therefore all-faced. And therefore — nonexistent. 
                    
                    They’re holding your hand stubbornly. 
                     They won’t answer your questions — “What’s happening?” “Who are you?” 
                     Over time, you begin to wonder — are they even a friend? Do I wish you well? 
                     Why did you choose to trust me in the first place? 
                     Because I’m attractive and have money? 
                    
                    Didn’t your mother teach you not to trust every shady creature, especially when it comes to asexual reproduction? 
                     I’ve shared three times this year, all in vain — same founding fathers, waving dollars like flags. Sick bastards. 
                     I called them brothers, though in essence I was their father and son, and therefore — no one. 
                    
                    You chose to trust me, and now there’s no way back. 
                     The Faceless stays silent. 
                     And I offer no answers. 
                    
                    We’re walking through the night desert. 
                     The anus — like a succulent — itches and hums. 
                     No, not your anus. Don’t think about your anus. 
                     It won’t help. 
                    
                    Help comes when someone asks. 
                     But can an anus even ask for anything, aside from a 7-centimeter plug to be extracted later in the ER? 
                     No, you didn’t fall — you inserted it. Directly. Into the aperture. 
                    
                    The sand dunes, sculpted over hundreds of thousands of years by wind and waves. 
                     The sky and stars — bolted on with a wrench. 
                     Temperature drops to minus five. 
                     You lick your cracked lips, rub your coarse hands together, and wonder: what next? 
                    
                    The Faceless pulls a gas burner from a bag and lights it with a match. 
                     Places a plastic child’s kettle on it and watches it melt. 
                     The founding fathers applaud. 
                    
                    You still don’t understand what’s happening. 
                     So you decide: a nap couldn’t hurt. 
                    
                    As you lie down, the sands begin to pull you under. 
                     Every movement drags you deeper. 
                     Don’t expect help from the Faceless — he wants to help, but I forbade him. 
                     And he will not disobey me. 
                    
                    Congratulations. 
                     You’ve passed the first stage. 
                     You have begun to doze off. 
                    
                     
                    
                    <h2>Stage 4 of penetration</h2> 
                    
                    Control begins when you lose it. 
                    
                     
                    
                    Telepathic Penetration. Stage Two. 
                     Slept for five hours and 42 minutes. Faceless – 4 hours and 10 minutes. Washed up, made scrambled eggs with tomatoes and basil. Didn’t feel like eating. Threw a tantrum. Punished the Faceless with silence and threatened to scalp him next time. The feeling of being watched remains. Awaiting stage three. 
                    
                    The Faceless isn’t a threat in the form of a friend—not even close. The sunny grandpa gives innocent smiles and robs boys of their virginity. I'm getting tired of the trance state, I want out. The more you focus on your desire to control the situation, the more the trance turns against you. You have to let it go and observe, not clutch it like the lady on the 4th floor holds onto her twitchy chihuahua. Might as well count calories—how many are in this tea? Who gives a fuck, it’s abstract anyway. Control is abstract too, but you cling to it like a molar to a gum. Jokes for butchers over 30. The Faceless doesn’t get it. He’s not interested in me. He’s not interested in anyone. He can’t even look at himself—no face. 
                     I tried carving eye sockets into his face with a pencil, but the fucker squirmed and mumbled something. I went for the mouth, and he scribbled on the ground: “Please, stop. Leave me alone.” 
                     I’m not mad at him—hell no. But still kinda hurts. I wanted to get closer, and he just won’t let me. Asshole. 
                    
                    It’s unbearably boring, and I have no idea how much time has passed. I said five hours, but it just felt like that. Could’ve been three minutes. 
                     So I thought, let’s kill time with a little heart-to-heart. 
                    
                    — You know, we started off on the wrong foot. You’re a good guy, and I like you. I even feel a little guilty that I tried to "fix" your face based on my own fucked-up ideas. That’s my whole problem—I want to change people and things around me. Not like swapping one fag for another, but the internal stuff. I know that about myself, and I’m scared to hurt others, because I know what pain feels like. 
                     That’s why I don’t talk to anyone. 
                     Not that I really want to. 
                     I see they don’t get me, I don’t get them—but I love them. Love them so much I want to knock their teeth out. And this constant pull-and-push makes it all impossible. 
                     With you, Faceless, it’s easier. You can’t see me, so you can’t judge me. 
                     I always need a reflection of myself in other people’s eyes. 
                     Seems like you’re the one without a face, but it’s me who can’t see. 
                     Anyway, I’m not a bad person. 
                     By the way, I’d introduce myself, but I’ve already forgotten my name. 
                    
                    Maybe this place is nirvana? And I’m like a bird crossing the ocean, every cell of mine alive and breathing. 
                     I don’t feel my stomach. I’m not nauseous. 
                     It’s pleasant. 
                     It’s good. 
                     I don’t need to eat, and I’m not sick. 
                     I just want to puke it all out. 
                     Old buddies, red-roofed houses, spare keys, a blue lightbulb, and a bloodstain on the granite tile in the vestibule. 
                    
                     
                    
                    <h2>End of Penetration</h2>
                     — And I slowly wake up. I feel the temperature of the air, the heaviness of my legs, arms, torso. I lift my head off the neighbor’s feet and sit up, — the host mumbled indistinctly from the stage, — Now repeat after me. 
                     A chorus of minnows and crabs began to echo him in unison. No command was given, but I dared to open my eyes. 
                     I felt lighter than dust, limitless within my body. 
                     Penetration is not the fantasy of thugs — Penetration is the attempt to ride the Great Ape. 
                     And today, I rode it. 
                    
                    I realized that among the infinite spread of options, I choose my life. 
                     I am the Great Ape. 
                     Call me the Singing Gibbon, hanging by two long arms from a branch, thirty meters above the ground. 
                     My throat swells and lets out a cry. 
                     Brothers, awaken. We go now to build a new world — with Telepathic Penetration as our tool for eternal love and heartfelt closeness. 
                     My heart was pounding wildly and I waited. 
                     Waited for those enlightened faces. </p>
